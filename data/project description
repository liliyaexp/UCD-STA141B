In this project, our task is to explore trends of the steel imports from year 2013 to 2018 
with respect to import steelâ€™s price and quantities 
and make a prediction on the unit price (in thousand dollars/Metric Tons) for future months. 
(i.e. make projection on our data until September, October, November and December 2018).

Project consists of 5 parts: Data exploration, Hypothesis tests, Classification, Model selection and Prediction.



Data source: 
    https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/steel_index.html 
    
We use the data on U.S. Census Bureau, a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data.
We use year-to-date and month-to-date datasets from year 2013 to 2018 on steel imports.

We save the data from the website into two csv files:
    p.csv: the steel import quantity and value with respect to different countries 
    c.csv: the steel import is the steel import with respect to product type
