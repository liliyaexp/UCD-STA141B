In this project, our task is to explore trends of the steel imports from year 2013 to 2018 
with respect to import steelâ€™s price and quantities 
and make a prediction on the unit price (in thousand dollars/Metric Tons) for future months. 
(i.e. make projection on our data until September, October, November and December 2018).

Project consists of 5 parts: Data exploration, Hypothesis tests, Classification, Model selection and Prediction.
